Release History
---------------

1.0.10 (2014-12-31)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Important:** The `dispatch` method now requires two arguments. Change
  `dispatch(HandleRequests)` to `dispatch(flask.request.get_json(),
  HandleRequests)`. This gives you the freedom to customize the way flask
  retrieves the json request. For example, pass `force=True` to retrieve the json
  body even if the request has the wrong Content-Type header.  See
  `flask.Request.get_json
  <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#flask.Request.get_json>`_.

- Blueprint error handling improved. Now gives certain errors, such as Internal
  Server Error, in the format requested by the client (in the Accept header).


1.0.9 (2014-12-31)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Bugfix: Fixed a critical bug where the blueprint wasn't catching exceptions!
- Logging has changed. See `Logging
  <https://jsonrpcserver.readthedocs.org/#logging>`_.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
