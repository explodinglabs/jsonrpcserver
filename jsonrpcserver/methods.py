"""A method is a Python function that can be called by a JSON-RPC request.

They're held in a dict, a mapping of function names to functions.

The @method decorator adds a method to jsonrpcserver's internal global_methods dict.
Alternatively pass your own dictionary of methods to `dispatch` with the methods param.

    >>> dispatch(request)  # Uses the internal collection of funcs added with @method
    >>> dispatch(request, methods={"ping": lambda: "pong"})  # Custom collection

Methods can take either positional or named arguments, but not both. This is a
limitation of JSON-RPC.
