1.0.10 (2014-12-31)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Important! The `dispatch` method now requires two arguments. Change
  `dispatch(HandleRequests)` to `dispatch(request.get_json(),
  HandleRequests)`. This gives you the freedom to customize the way flask
  retrieves the json request. For example, pass `force=True` to ignore the
  mimetype sent from the client. See `get_json
  <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#flask.Request.get_json>`_.

  Server Error, in the format requested by the client (in the Accept header).
