# jsonrpcserver Change Log

## 6.0.0 (May 18, 2022)

A small release but incrementing the major release number due to a breaking
change for async use.

Breaking changes:

- Async methods should be decorated with `@async_method` instead of `@method`. The
  reason is due to the _type_ of the decorated function - async functions have a
  different type to other functions (`Awaitable`).

Other changes:

- Replaced the Oslash dependency with [Returns](https://github.com/dry-python/returns).
  Oslash is not meant for production use, and doesn't work in Python 3.12.
- Use `Ok` instead of `Success` when returning a response. This is to avoid confusion
  with the Returns library's `Success` class. It also matches Jsonrpcclient's `Ok` type.
  This is not a breaking change, `Success` will still work for now.
- Docs moved to https://github.com/explodinglabs/jsonrpcserver/wiki

- Methods must now return a Result (Success or Error).
- The dispatch function now returns a string.
- Methods collection is now a simple dict, the Methods class has been removed.
- Changed all classes (Request, Response, Methods, etc) to namedtuples.
- Logging removed. User can log instead.
- Config file removed. Configure with arguments to dispatch.
- Removed "trim log values" and  "convert camel case" options.
- Removed the custom exceptions, replaced with one JsonRpcError exception.

## 4.2.0 (Nov 9, 2020)

- Add ability to use custom serializer and deserializer ([#125](https://github.com/explodinglabs/jsonrpcserver/pull/125))
- Add ability to use custom method name ([#127](https://github.com/explodinglabs/jsonrpcserver/pull/127))
- Deny additional parameters in json-rpc request ([#128](https://github.com/explodinglabs/jsonrpcserver/pull/128))

Thanks to deptyped.

## 4.1.3 (May 2, 2020)

- In the case of a method returning a non-serializable value, return a JSON-RPC
  error response. It was previously erroring server-side without responding to
  the client. (#119)
- Fix for Python 3.8 - ensures the same exceptions will be raised in 3.8 and
  pre-3.8. (#122)

## 4.1.2 (Jan 9, 2020)

- Fix the egg-info directory in package.

## 4.1.1 (Jan 8, 2020)

- Fix file permission on all files.

## 4.1.0 (Jan 6, 2020)

- Add InvalidParamsError exception, for input validation. Previously the
  advice was to `assert` on input values. However, AssertionError was too
  generic an exception. Instead, raise InvalidParamsError. Note `assert` will
  still work but will be removed in the next major release (5.0).
- Add an ApiError exception; raise it to send an application defined error
  response. This covers the line in the JSON-RPC spec, "The remainder of the
  space is available for application defined errors."
- A KeyError raised inside methods will no longer send a "method not found"
  response.
- Uncaught exceptions raised inside methods will now be logged. We've been
  simply responding to the client with a Server Error. Now the traceback will
  also be logged server-side.
- Fix a deprecation warning related to collections.abc.
- Add py.typed to indicate this package supports typing. (PEP 561)

Thanks to steinymity for his work on this release.

## 4.0.5 (Sep 10, 2019)

- Include license in package.

## 4.0.4 (Jun 22, 2019)

- Use faster method of jsonschema validation
- Use inspect from stdlib, removing the need for funcsigs

## 4.0.3 (Jun 15, 2019)

- Update dependencies to allow jsonschema version 3.x
- Support Python 3.8

## 4.0.2 (Apr 13, 2019)

- Fix to allow passing context when no parameters are passed.

## 4.0.1 (Dec 21, 2018)

- Include exception in ExceptionResponse. Closes #74.

## 4.0.0 (Oct 14, 2018)

_The 4.x releases will support Python 3.6+ only._

- Dispatch now works only with `Methods` object. No longer accepts a
  dictionary or list.
- `dispatch` no longer requires a "methods" argument. If not passed, uses the
  global methods object.
- Methods initialiser has a simpler api - Methods(func1, func2, ...) or
  Methods(name1=func1, name2=func2, ...).
- No more jsonrpcserver exceptions. Calling code will _always_ get a valid
  JSON-RPC response from `dispatch`. The old `InvalidParamsError` is gone
  - instead do a regular `assert` on arguments.
- `response.is_notification` renamed to `response.wanted`, which is the
  opposite of is_notification. This means the original request was not a
  notification, it had an id, and does expect a response.
- Removed "respond to notification errors" option, which broke the
  specification. We still respond to invalid json/json-rpc requests, in which
  case it's not possible to know if the request is a notification.
- Removed the "config" module. Added external config file, `.jsonrpcserverrc`.
  (alternatively configure with arguments to dispatch)
- Removed the "six" dependency, no longer needed.
- Configure logging Pythonically.
- Add type hints
- Move tests to pytest
- Passing a context object to dispatch now sets it as the first positional
  argument to the method. `def fruits(ctx, color):`
- Check params with regular asserts.

## 3.5.6 (Jun 28, 2018)
- Add trim_log_values dispatch param. (#65)
- Fix a missing import

## 3.5.5 (Jun 19, 2018)
- Rewrite of dispatch(), adding parameters to configure the dispatch that were
  previously configured by modifying the `config` module. That module is now
  deprecated and will be removed in 4.0.

- Refactoring

## 3.5.3 (Dec 19, 2017)

## 3.5.0 (Aug 12, 2017)
